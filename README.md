# Normalizing OECD Health System Inputs to Country's Age Structure
Usually, to check how they are faring compared to others, countries' compare their health system's inputs aggregates to the normal OECD average.

However, as different countries have different age compositions, their actual need for health system inputs changes:

On the one hand, countries like Germany and Japan - with an older population mix - might have more need for said inputs than others;
On the other hand, countries like Israel and Mexico - with a much younger population - might have less need for said inputs.
To tackle this issue, this small app allows comparing a country's input aggregate with the appropriate OECD average, normalized to said country's age structure.
Have a go!
